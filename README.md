# master-thesis-uzh
I want to keep my files from my Master Thesis, so they dont get lost in the depth of a harddisk. I probably do not update/edit this content. The folder includes Stata code for detailed fixed effects regression analysis and R code for graphics. I wrote the thesis in LaTeX.

The [Stata Code](stata-code-MA.do) contains the statistical analysis;
the folder [figures](figures) contains R code for figures and output pictures.
