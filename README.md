# Master thesis at the University of Zurich
I want to keep my files from my Master Thesis, so they dont get lost in the depth of a harddisk. I probably do not update/edit this content. The folder includes Stata code for detailed fixed effects regression analysis, R code for graphics and .tex files for the thesis.

## Folder structure and files
* [abstract](abstract.pdf): describes the subject of the thesis
* [src](src): Contains all code
    - [figures](src/figures): Contains R code for figures
        - [figure_01](src/figures/figure_01)
    - [fixed-effects-reg.do](src/fixed-effects-reg.do): Contains the statistical analysis
    - [thesis](src/thesis): Contains all .tex files
        - [cover](src/thesis/cover)
            - [inside](src/thesis/cover/inside)
            - [outside](src/thesis/cover/outside)
        - [main](src/thesis/main)
