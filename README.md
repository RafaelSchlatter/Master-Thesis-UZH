# Master thesis at the University of Zurich
I want to keep my files from my Master Thesis, so they dont get lost in the depth of a harddisk. I probably do not update/edit this content. The folder includes Stata code for detailed fixed effects regression analysis, R code for graphics and .tex files for the thesis.

## Publication
My thesis was published in the the Junior Management Science (JUMS) journal on the 21.03.2018, and can be accessed at below links.

- Article website: <https://jums.academy/r-schlatter/>, includes appendices;
- DOI: <https://doi.org/10.5282/jums/v3i1pp88-122>.
