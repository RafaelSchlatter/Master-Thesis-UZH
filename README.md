# master-thesis-uzh
I want to keep my files from my Master Thesis, so they dont get lost in the depth of a harddisk. I probably do not update/edit this content. The folder includes Stata code for detailed fixed effects regression analysis, R code for graphics and .tex files for the thesis.

## Folder structure
