# Master thesis at the University of Zurich
I want to keep my files from my Master Thesis, so they dont get lost in the depth of a harddisk. I probably do not update/edit this content. The folder includes Stata code for detailed fixed effects regression analysis, R code for graphics and .tex files for the thesis.

## Folder structure and files
* [abstract](abstract.pdf): describes the subject of the thesis
* [thesis](thesis): Contains all code
    - [figures](thesis/figures): Contains R and TeX code for figures
    - [fixed-effects-reg.do](thesis/fixed-effects-reg.do): Contains the statistical analysis
    - [MA_LaTeX.tex](src/thesis): Contains all TeX code for the thesis
        - [cover](thesis/cover)
            - [inside](thesis/cover/inside)
            - [outside](thesis/cover/outside)
