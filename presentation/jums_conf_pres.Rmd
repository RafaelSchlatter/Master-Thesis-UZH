\end{center}

- studied at the University of Zurich (2011-2017)
- thesis written in Summer 2017, appeared in JUMS in March 2018
- currently working in an analytics role in Oslo
- like running, snow sports, coding and reading 

## What is it about?

- **Do Swiss multinational enterprises shift profits?**

- *multinational enterprise*: Corporate group with different legal affiliates (Swiss parent & foreign subsidiaries) in different countries

- *shifting profits*: deliberately and artificially relocate income to low-taxed jurisdictions

## Ways to shift profits
Affiliates (parent & subsidiary companies of the same enterprise)  

- Sell intermediate goods from high-taxed (low-taxed) affiliate to low-taxed (high-taxed) affiliate at above (below) market price

- Provide loans from high-taxed (low-taxed) affiliate to low-taxed (high-taxed) affiliate at below (above) market interest rate

- The taxes saved amount to the difference in tax rates multiplied by the transfer price or interest payment


## Why is it interesting to study profit shifting in Switzerland?
![Tax differentials in Europe in 2015](pic/europe_maps.pdf)

- Tax differential: $\tau = \textrm{foreign tax rate} - \textrm{Swiss tax rate}$

# How was it done?
## How to study profit shifting?

- Find a relationship between earnings **before** interest and taxes, and tax differentials
- $H_{0}:$ EBIT is not influenced by taxes (in the absence of profit shifting)
- There exist other ways (e.g. using transfer prices)

## Data
- unit of observation: subsidiary of a Swiss parent company
- panel data: each subsidiary observed over multiple years, 2007-2015
- balance sheet data from ORBIS (Bureau van Dijk)
- tax data from KPMG, GDP data from the World Bank
- sample size: 4'862 subsidiaries, 26'869 observations (from 63 countries)

## More data

## Model
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \ln \Pi_{it} & = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot \ln A_{it}+\beta_2 \cdot \ln L_{it} \\
  & + \beta_3 \cdot \ln K_{it} - \beta_4 \cdot \tau_{it} +u_{it} 
\end{aligned}
$$

- $\Pi_{it}$: Earnings before interest and taxes,
- $A$: Technology input (GDP per capita),
- $L$: Labour input,
- $K$: Capital input,
- $\tau$: Tax differential (subsidiary rate - Swiss rate)
- Fixed effects (subsidiary, time) also included but left out for simplicity

$\rightarrow H_{0}$: $\beta_{4}$ = 0, $\rightarrow H_{A}$ (profit shifting): $\beta_{4} < 0$


## How to use the model?
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \ln \Pi_{it} & = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot \ln A_{it}+\beta_2 \cdot \ln L_{it} \\
  & + \beta_3 \cdot \ln K_{it} - \beta_4 \cdot \tau_{it} +u_{it} 
\end{aligned}
$$

- Marginal effect: $\partial \ln \Pi_{it} / \partial \tau_{it} = - \beta_{4}$
- log-level specification: Marginal effect can be interpreted as a semi-elasticity
- **"A change in $\tau_{it}$ by 1 percentage point (0.01) is associated with an average decrease of $\Pi_{it}$ by $\beta_{4}$ percent."**

# What are the findings?
## Some results
- $\beta_{4} = - 1.458 \textrm{ (} t\textrm{-statistic: }-3.390)$, statistically significant
- **If the tax differential increases by 1 percentage point, the subsidiary EBIT decreases by 1.458\%.**
- Beer & Loeprick (2015): $-1.00$, Dischinger (2008): $-0.75$

## Interpreting the result
**Example 1: The average subsidiary**

EBIT = $698'716$ CHF, tax differential = $0.082$ $\rightarrow$ effect = $698'716 \textrm{ CHF} \cdot -1.458\% = -10'481$ CHF


**Example 2: ABB AS, Norwegian subsidiary (wholly owned, 2013 data)**

EBIT = $127'834'360$ CHF, tax differential = $0.10$ $\rightarrow$ effect = $127'834'360 \textrm{ CHF} \cdot -1.458\% = -1'863'825$ CHF


# Conclusion
## Shortcomings
- Ownership data: not available, shifting between subsidiaries not respected
- Ownership data: for last year available only
- ORBIS: low coverage for tax havens
- Losses: Companies with a loss have a different incentive to shift profits

## Points for discussion
- Is profit shifting unethical or a smart way to maximise income?

- Should countries with low effective taxes be put under pressure?

- Is international cooperation necessary to build tax laws or should market forces guide the way to an equilibrium?
