# Introduction

## About me

- Studied at the University of Zurich (2011-2017)
- Thesis written in Summer 2017
- Currently living and working in Oslo

## Research question

- **Do Swiss multinational enterprises shift income?**

(Do they deliberately and
artificially relocate income to low taxed jurisdictions?)

## Context
Why is it interesting to study this?

# Methodology
## Model
- Fixed-effects regression approach

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \ln \Pi_{it} & = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot \ln A_{it}+\beta_2 \cdot \ln L_{it} \\
  & + \beta_3 \cdot \ln K_{it} - \beta_4 \cdot \tau_{it} +u_{it} 
\end{aligned}
$$
