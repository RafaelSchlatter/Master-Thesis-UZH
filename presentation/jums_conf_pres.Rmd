# Introduction
## About me

- Studied at the University of Zurich (2011-2017)
- Thesis written in Summer 2017
- Currently living and working in Oslo

## What is it about?

- **Do Swiss multinational enterprises shift profits?**

- *multinational enterprise*: Corporate group with different legal affiliates (Swiss parent & foreign subsidiaries) in different countries

- *shifting profits*: deliberately and artificially relocate income to low-taxed jurisdictions

## How to shift profits?
INCLUDE GRAPHIC HERE!!!
Affiliates (parent & subsidiary companies of the same enterprise)  

- Sell intermediate goods from high-taxed (low-taxed) affiliate to low-taxed (high-taxed) affiliate at above (below) market price

- Provide loans from high-taxed (low-taxed) affiliate to low-taxed (high-taxed) affiliate at below (above) market interest rate

- The taxes saved amount to the difference in tax rates multiplied by the transfer price or interest payment


## Why is it interesting to study profit shifting in Switzerland?
![Tax differentials in Europe in 2015](europe_maps.pdf)

- Tax differential: $\tau = \textrm{foreign tax rate} - \textrm{Swiss tax rate}$

# Methodology
## How to study profit shifting?

- Some relationship between affiliates needed
- EBIT should not be influenced by taxes (in the absence of profit shifting)

## Model
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \ln \Pi_{it} & = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot \ln A_{it}+\beta_2 \cdot \ln L_{it} \\
  & + \beta_3 \cdot \ln K_{it} - \beta_4 \cdot \tau_{it} +u_{it} 
\end{aligned}
$$

- $\Pi_{it}$: Earnings before interest and taxes,
- $A$: Technology input (GDP per capita),
- $L$: Labour input,
- $K$: Capital input,
- $\tau$: Tax differential (subsidiary rate - Swiss rate)


## How to use the model?
Partial differentiation
